# GraphQL Server

In this section we are going to setup a GraphQL server using Spring Boot. Before we get started please read about 
[GraphQL Execution](https://graphql.github.io/learn/execution/) so that you have a grasp on the terminology we are going
to use.

## Setup
* Import the [graphql-java-server/](graphql-java-server) folder into your favorite IDE.
  * This project uses lombok. For information on how to add this to your IDE, go to [their website](https://projectlombok.org/).
  * If you are using intellij go to File &rarr; New &rarr; Project From Existing Sources &rarr; Import as a Gradle project
